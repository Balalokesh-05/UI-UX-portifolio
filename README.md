Interactive Resume & Portfolio
This repository contains my interactive, single-page resume and portfolio. The web application is designed to provide a dynamic and engaging overview of my skills, projects, and educational background. It offers a more modern and user-friendly experience than a traditional static document.

Purpose
This project serves as a showcase of my technical and design skills, specifically highlighting my:

HTML & Tailwind CSS proficiency: For creating a clean, responsive, and professional layout.

JavaScript logic: For managing interactive elements, dynamic data, and smooth user experiences.

UX/UI principles: The design and structure are built to be intuitive and easy to navigate, with a focus on a clear information hierarchy.



Technical Stack
HTML: The core structure of the page.

Tailwind CSS: For styling and a responsive layout.

JavaScript: For interactivity and dynamic content.

Chart.js: For visualizing skills data in a dynamic chart.
